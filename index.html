        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Ken Dosemagen and welcome to my portfolio. I started
          out my journey about two years ago with a coding course I picked up on
          sale at Udemy. I was working a full-time job at the time and have two
          small girls to take care of making it hard to concentrate and focus
          while on my path into coding. I found that I got hooked at first with
          the HTML and CSS courses but by the time I got to JavaScript I
          couldn‚Äôt keep myself awake long enough to really comprehend what I was
          trying to learn. About a year after I stopped working on the
          self-taught courses, I decided I wanted to continue to learn more and
          become a web developer just in a different way. I have recently
          completed a one-year, technical diploma in web development from
          Gateway Technical College. I enjoyed my time learning everything I
          could in my classes no matter how many obstacles I had to overcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my time back in school we covered the basics and some more advanced
          HTML and CSS. But on top of that I learned about Java programming and
          JavaScript, Python, PHP, Databases, MongoDB, and React development. I
          learned its ok not to know everything because being a web developer is
          about constant learning and building your skills over all and being
          open to new concepts and willing to learn new languages to fit the
          needs of the market. I personally love building sites with just plane
          old HTML and CSS and a little JavaScript. I have a few examples of my
          work a little further down this page.
        </p>

        <p>
          I plan on going back to school at some point soon to get a bachelor‚Äôs
          degree in web development. Although it may not be necessary for all
          positions I feel as though it couldn‚Äôt hurt to have the degree. I
          enjoy learning new ways to code and new languages. My favorite area of
          web design is the front-end development. Planning out how a site will
          look and building it from the ground up is, yes, a little frustrating
          at times but overall fun to me. I aspire to have a career in web
          development and learn and grow with the knowledge of many different
          programming languages under my belt.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Some projects I have worked on will have links below but as a brief
          description, during my time working on my diploma, I built a website
          for a family member‚Äôs fencing business. Unfortunately, the business
          had to close before I could deploy the page. Another project I worked
          on was a simple goal tracking website. The premise was to help people
          get motivated and set life goals for them selves and when they
          completed a goal, they could move it to the completed goals section.
          This used PHP and a little database to track someone‚Äôs goals. The last
          project I will have listed is my landing page I used for my classes to
          turn in assignments and projects. It is just simple HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          I was nominated by an instructor to become a part of the NSLS
          (National Society for Leadership and Success). I was recognized as an
          exemplary student that exceeded to criteria for the membership to the
          NSLS. This is only offered to a small percentage of students.
